                           at the Mojang server. This will override the given
                           session id (if given) and the username with that

  --save-lastlogin         Writes back the username and password into
                           the lastlogin file, but only after successfull
                           authentication (therefor --authenticate must be

  --title=TITLE            Replace the window title.
  --height=HEIGHT          The width of the window.
  --width=WIDTH            The height of the window.
  --x=X                    The x-location of the window.
  --y=Y                    The y-location of the window.
  --maximized              Maximize the window.
  --no-frame               Remove the border of the window.
  --always-on-top          Make the window stay above all others.
  --fullscreen             Makes the window the same size as the whole desktop.
                           This is basically shorthand for
                             --width=SCREENWIDTH
                             --height=SCREENHEIGHT
                             --x=0
                             --y=0
                             --no-frame
                             --always-on-top
                           This might yield odd results in multi-monitor
                           environments.
  --opacity=OPACITY        Sets the opacity of the window, were 1 is fully
                           visible, 0 is invisble and 0.5 is half visible.
                           This might or might not work depending on your WM and
                           or compositor. This also forces --no-frame.
  --dump                   Chickens out before doing anything and prints all
                           of the configuration values.
  --no-exit                Does not exit on failure (if Minecraft could not be
                           loaded), only returns.
