                           to connect to.
  --authenticate           Use the given username and password to authenticate
                           at the Mojang server. This will override the given
                           session id (if given) and the username with that
                           returned from Mojang (case corrected).
  --authentication-failure=Set the behavior if the authentication fails,
                           following values are possible:
    SILENT_CONTINUE        Just continue, there will only be a notification

                           Default is "381".
  --options-file=FILE      Copy the options.txt from this location.
                           Please be aware that this overwrites the options.txt
                           in the Minecraft directory. This will also be done
                           before --texturepack and --set-option.
  --set-option=NAME:VALUE  Set this option in the options.txt file.
  --username=USERNAME      Set the username to user.

  --save-lastlogin         Writes back the username and password into
                           the lastlogin file, but only after successfull
                           authentication (therefor --authenticate must be
                           provided, too).
  --keep-username          Do not override the username with that returned from
                           Mojang. Only applies when --authenticate is provided.

  --title=TITLE            Replace the window title.
  --height=HEIGHT          The width of the window.
  --width=WIDTH            The height of the window.
  --x=X                    The x-location of the window.
  --y=Y                    The y-location of the window.
  --maximized              Maximize the window.
  --no-frame               Remove the border of the window.
  --always-on-top          Make the window stay above all others.
  --fullscreen             Makes the window the same size as the whole desktop.
                           This is basically shorthand for
                             --width=SCREENWIDTH
                             --height=SCREENHEIGHT
                             --x=0
                             --y=0
                             --no-frame
                             --always-on-top
                           This might yield odd results in multi-monitor
                           environments.
