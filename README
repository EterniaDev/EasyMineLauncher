EasyMineLauncher
----------------

An easy and lightweight launcher for Minecraft which takes some of the hassle away.


What it does:
-------------

 * Removes the need to login if you just want to play offline or on a private server
 * There's no check for an update, you're directly catapulted to the main menu
 * Additional parameters (f.e. start as maximized window or loading of certain versions from different directories)


What it does not:
-----------------

 * Remove the need to authenticate at servers if they demand it
 * Loading and applying updates
 * Let's you play Minecraft for free, you'll still need to get an account and download the binaries


How does it work?
-----------------

Basically this is just mimicking the behavior of the official launcher, except that it removes the online authentication and the update process. I figured most of that out with Trial & Error, that's why it's looking a little bit crude and has debugging output all over the place.


What can I do with it?
----------------------

Awesome stuff?
